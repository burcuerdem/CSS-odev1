    <h1>Best Cat Food Ingredients And Litter Quality</h1>
    <h2>Food Ingredients For Healthy Cat</h2>
    <p>
 You are what you eat – and the same goes for your cat! Here’s what you need to look for in your cat’s dry food. <br>
 When you start your search for a quality dry cat food, you need to first do your research. After all, a quality dry cat food is only as good as its ingredients. <br>
 Before you start shopping, you should know how important the ingredients are – and that’s why we’re going to talk about the top five healthy cat food ingredients you need to see on the label.
 <ul>
    <li>Protein as the First Ingredient</li>
    <p> Cats are obligate carnivores, and as such, a quality dry cat food needs to list a protein as its first ingredient – no exceptions! <br>
    Not only that, but the protein needs to be named – it shouldn’t just list “meat.” Look for chicken, turkey, lamb, or salmon. <br>
    When you look at any of Wellness’ cat food recipes, you’ll notice that a high-quality protein is listed right at the top of the ingredient list. </p>

    <li>Omega 3s and 6s</li>
    <p>Essential in supporting your cat’s immune system and other important biological functions, Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids can be found in fish oil, eggs, and flaxseed.<br>
    A quality dry cat food includes Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, which will also help give your cat smooth skin and a gorgeous coat.</p>

    <li>Vitamins and Minerals</li>
    <p>A robust list of vitamins and minerals should be a part of a quality dry cat food.<br>
    Not only do they provide a complete and balanced diet, but they support a healthy immune system and promote a shiny, healthy coat.<br>
    On the list of ingredients, look for water-soluble vitamins B12 and C, plus minerals such as calcium, iron and zinc.</p>

    <li>Healthy Fats</li>
    <p>On top of Omega 3 and 6, other healthy fats are essential in a quality dry cat food, especially when it comes to storing energy.<br>
    Did you know that cats need 20 to 24 percent fat in their food? That means that both protein and fat need to be relatively high to ensure a healthy diet. </p>

    <li>Probiotics</li>
    <p>You should also look for guaranteed levels of probiotics to support digestion.<br>
    This is the “friendly bacteria” that reside in your cat’s digestive tract. Probiotics promote a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut,<br>
    which is important for complete digestion and absorption of nutrients. As well, probiotics help keep your cat’s immune system strong,<br>
    making them a must-have ingredient for cats with digestive disorders.</p>
 </ul>
